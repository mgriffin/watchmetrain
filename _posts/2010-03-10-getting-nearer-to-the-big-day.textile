Just over a week away from the big day now.
Things are getting more and more organised, still some small matters to attend to, but the papers are with the church, the priest is ready, the church and hotel are booked and the invites are out and replied to.

Because of this I haven't been able to get out and do any training or anything, but I did get a 2 hour mountain bike spin in Galway after my stag last weekend and a short run last week.

No plans to do anything mad for the next week, maybe a short run some evening and then Munster League on Saturday in Limerick.
