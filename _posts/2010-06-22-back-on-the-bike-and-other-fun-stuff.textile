It's good to be back on my bike again. I cycled in to work this morning in the sun and it really woke me up.

It's really been laziness that has kept me off it for the last while and now I plan on keeping on it while the weather is nice at least.

Shannon Gaels have been doing well in the league this year. We're top of the league with two games left and looking good for promotion at least.

I entered IM Lanzarote 2011 last week. That'll be a big focus for me over the winter and to add to the fun my sister and her boyfriend will be doing it too. I'll be keeping that in mind when the training starts to get tough!

I got a nice long run in last Thursday while I was in Castlebar with work. It was an hour from the hotel to Turlough Park and back again. Even splits too for the two halves. IT was very heavy and humid, but I missed the rain shower that soaked my boss.
