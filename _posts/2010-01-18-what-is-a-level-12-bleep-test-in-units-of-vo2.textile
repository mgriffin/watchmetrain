I did a bleep test on Saturday evening. We do it during the first football training session of the season to gauge how far we have to go to get to a decent level of fitness. I missed the one last year, so this is my first gauge.

I arrived late because I had driven from Newbridge after a pre wedding course that myself and Louise did. I also had a very bad sleep the night before but that's a different story. When I arrived, the first thing I had to do was three 40m sprints and then it was the bleep test on my own as the other guys had done it already.

I was comfortable throughout and it was only when I stopped voluntarily at level 12.4 that I started to get a coughing fit. Oh yeah, I had had a cold for a few days beforehand too. I was really pleased with how far I managed to get considering all those things. I guess the mileage in December really paid off.

We had more training on Sunday morning, a 30 minute match and then some stamina laps of the pitch. I was told to lead the rest out and set the pace. I enjoyed the harder running sections but I could feel it in my chest for the rest of the day. Today I am a little stiff in my back and hamstrings, but I was back commuting on the bike which should help to loosen things out.

Off to the gym tomorrow evening for some weights and a swim after work I think.
