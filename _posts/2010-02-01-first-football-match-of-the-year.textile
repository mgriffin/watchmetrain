We played the first match of the year on Saturday evening against Dromahair. I was playing midfield and scored a point in the second half. It's been that long since I scored in a match, I had almost forgotten what it felt like!

We won pretty comfortably thanks to two early goals, but we still managed 20 wides over the course of the game. I was quite tired going into it because I had a late night and early morning before it. My own fault, but it wasn't an important match.

I was a bit stiff on Sunday and today, which was to be expected as the match went on for 75 minutes instead of 60. There were a lot of tired bodies coming off that field.
