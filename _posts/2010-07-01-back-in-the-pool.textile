I went for a swim on my way home last night. Nothing major, I only managed to do 700m but it's a start. Part of the reason I only did that much was because I forgot my lock for the lockers and had to leave it open. I just didn't feel right doing that.

I did a 100m sprint at the end of the session to gauge where I am and finished it in 1:38. I think this needs some work, but with it being my first session in a while, I wasn't too disappointed.
