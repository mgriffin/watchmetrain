I went for a run yesterday morning in the snow. Nothing major, just something to stretch my legs out a bit. The only problem was that it was getting warmer so the snow on the paths was beginning to melt and get really slippy. 

I went over to Castletown house and did a lap of the field in front of the house. That part was lovely, powdery snow and a few people out walking their dogs. 

There were some kids out making snowmen as well, they were making a better fist of it than some of us older people did the night before. This is all we managed:
