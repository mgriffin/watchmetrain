I got a pair of these while I was away on honeymoon and finally went out for a run in them at lunchtime.

I've walked around a bit in them and they are pretty comfy for that. I had heard that you should start with short runs and build up because they are so different to running in shoes. I went for a 20 minute jaunt to the Phoenix Park to try them out on as many surfaces as possible.

As I left work I was on tarmac, moved on to concrete footpaths, through some gravel at roadworks and up a hill on more concrete footpaths. Into the park and back on to tarmac, cobbles and finally grass. The ground was very hard but it was definitely easier to run on the grass than anywhere else. A quick loop incorporating some deer poo and fallen sticks completed the terrain changes before heading back to work on the concrete and tarmac.

Off road running was easy, uphills and downhills were no problem. On road was a different matter. Uphills were fine but downhills and even flat sections needed a bit more thought. Because there is no cushioning at all, any heel striking to slow down is very noticible. This meant that I was trying to slow down on my toes which caused a little bit of chafing on the top of my foot.

My calves were tight anyway from running a couple of days ago but I still need to do a lot of stretching regardless of that. My legs will feel this tomorrow.
