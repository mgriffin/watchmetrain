It's been a while since it rained for a whole day and today the weather decided would be the day. The first duathlon in the Phoenix Park is tonight and it's going to be a damp one. 

There was proper rain this morning which has morphed into sticky drizzle by this afternoon. It even looks like it is starting to brighten up at the moment. 

Looking forward to the race tonight. There seems to be a large field, something like 60 pre entered in the first wave alone. Wet or dry, it should be a good race.
