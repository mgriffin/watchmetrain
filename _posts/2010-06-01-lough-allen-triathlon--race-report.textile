I did the "Lough Allen Triathlon":http://loughallentriathlon.wordpress.com last weekend. It was a last minute idea, I only entered in the Wednesday before but it was well worth it.

The swim start had to be moved 5km down the road due to rocks and debris in the original swim spot, so that meant a split transition. I dropped my bike down and set it all up. Well most of it. I couldn't find my pump or repair kit and thought I had left them at home. I had resigned myself to getting a flat and DNFing until I was getting changed and found them both, along with my HRM strap, in my bag rather than the box with the rest of my gear.

The swim was a two lap affair and we were supposed to get out of the water and run around a traffic cone. The area was too rocky so they moved the cone into the water instead. I did a reasonable 15 minute swim even though I felt like I was struggling the whole time.

The bike leg started with me being passed by two guys that appeared to be working hard together for as long as I could see them. I got into my rhythm and started passing people out. Going through Dowra I was cheered on by a guy I had played a match with the night before. 

From there it was a tough rolling road on to Drumkeerin where we were greeted with a wide, well surfaced, long downhill. Into top gear and keep pedalling! I was passed out by a couple of guys here but kept them in view until the transition.

On the run I was feeling very weary. I had a sore leg that didn't like downhills and tired legs that didn't like uphills. I still managed to pass out some people on the way out and kept myself occupied with counting how many were in front of me. I managed to get through the run despite my head telling me to stop on a number of occasions and finished in 11th place overall.

It was a tough day out there. I need to swim more often. The cycle was into a headwind for the first half and even the downhills felt hard, but the second half made up for it. The run really hurt but a lot of that was from an injury that I picked up the night before playing a match. I was happy with the time I finished in but a top 10 would have been nice!
