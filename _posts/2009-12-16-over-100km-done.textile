Day 11 and I am up to 106km and change. A little behind where I need to be, but I think I can catch up.

This morning was an extension of the Ballyfermot - Inchicore - Harolds Cross - Work run that brought it to just over 11km. It was another lovely morning for a run and quite busy on the paths near Baggot Street. After getting to the office I started to get some slight stomach cramps but I think that was to do with not having brekkie before leaving the house (bold Mike)

Here's the route taken from "RunKeeper.com":http://www.runkeeper.com
