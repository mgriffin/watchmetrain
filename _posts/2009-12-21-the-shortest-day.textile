A lovely 13km run in this morning in the frost and crisp air. It was nice to see everyone wrapped up and hugging coffee cups for warmth while I was loping along past them.

I took a couple of days off after the wedding on Friday to recharge and try and get some sleep. It seems to have worked well, I felt really good this morning. 

I'm 20km behind where I should be today but I'm feeling good and should be able to get a few 15km runs to get me back on track. I'm looking forward to running on something that isn't concrete when I get home for Christmas, some trail running might be in order.
