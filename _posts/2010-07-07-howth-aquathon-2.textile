I did the second Howth aquathon on Monday evening. Pauline was home from Manchester and herself and Greg did it too.

The swim course was slightly different this time, a clockwise swim instead of an anti-clockwise one but still two laps for us long course people.  I came out of the water in 19:30 on my watch in 21st place. 

I ripped off the timing chip in transition when I was taking off my wetsuit but luckily I saw it and put it back on. Then off on the run. I set off at a decent pace and was happy to overtake a lot of people. I also did a negative split over the two laps (10:42 and 10:19)

I finished in seventh place, seven seconds behind the sixth place guy and 4:50 behind the winner.  

If I had swum three minutes faster, I could have been challenging for third place. I think I should work on that for the next day!
