I decided to try a different route today. I left Ballyfermot and headed to Inchicore. From there to the canal and along it to Harold's Cross before coming back to Christchurch and down to the quays. Then finally back to the museum. I thought it would be more than the 9.8km that it actually was, but it was a nice route anyway.
