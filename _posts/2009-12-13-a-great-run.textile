This evening I went for a lovely little run. I wanted to get back on track so I decided I needed to get around 20km done. In the end I got to almost 18km.

I did a loop with Louise, and then she went home and I went on to finish off another 11km. I upped the pace and surprised myself at how long I could keep a good pace going for. 

I'm now up on around 124km or so for the month, still behind on the daily 10km needed to finish but not too bad. I'm planning a few 11-12km runs to bring me back on track over the next few days and then a nice long run next weekend.

Here's the map of today's run:
