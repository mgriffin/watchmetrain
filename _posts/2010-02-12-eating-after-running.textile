You'ld think I'd know by now that I can't eat a lot straight after I do exercise. But no. Last night I did it again.

I ran home from work, 20km, cold, crisp and really enjoyable. I was thinking about food for the last few km so when I got in the door, I immediately knocked back a protein shake with extra go faster powder in it. Then I cooked up my dinner and sat down to eat. I couldn't stomach very much but thought I should at least try and get some in.

I was feeling poorly and when Louise came in, she said my eyes was looking pretty sick. I thought I would be okay, but no. It all came back up later on. After that I was feeling fine though. 

So that proves it again. Only eat something small, or keep eating during exercise. Hopefully this will stop me feeling like crap!
