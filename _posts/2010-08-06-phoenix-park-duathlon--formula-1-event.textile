Wednesday saw the last duathlon in the Phoenix Park organised by "Belpark":http://dublintri.com. This one had a slightly different format to it. Instead of run-bike-run, this was run-bike-run-bike-run. A novel twist and made for some interesting happenings.

It started off well for me with a 9:07 run. Then on to the bike and I thought I was doing well until the second lap when I was passed out by a few people. Onto the second run and another good leg (10:40 this time)

I had left my shoes on the bike after the first bike leg and thought that I would be okay putting them on while on the bike. Unfortunately my mind went blank and I forgot what I was supposed to be doing. This lost me some time but when I got them on, I was able to whizz past a lot of people from the second wave. Quite a rush to be flying past people on the rougher area of the path, all the while trying to catch that pesky group ahead of me.

There was some back and forth between myself and another guy on the bike and we both got into transition around the same time. Onto the run and I had some targets in my sights. Before the half way point, I heard heavy breathing and footsteps behind me and was passed out. I tried to hang on to him, but no luck, he was flying!

Into the last straight and out of the wind, I tried to push on again but the spag bol I had eaten earlier was trying it's best to say hello again. I had to ease off and this let the guy I had passed earlier to fly past me in the last 100m. I couldn't respond and he finished 2 seconds ahead of me.

I finished in 1:01:22 in 19th place and 5:57 behind the winner. I'm happy with that time, maybe I could have beaten the hour if I had trained for it but with the work I have (haven't) done, it's a good result.

The wind was very strong on the run. The second part of the lap was right into a headwind and I think most people struggled. On the bike it felt at times I was wrestling a walrus! I need to get some more time on the tri bike and get used to those race wheels in the breeze.
