I had a slow run in to work today from Ballyfermot. A couple of niggles are starting to surface, I need to stretch a bit more often. My left foot is feeling tight and my right soleus as well. These are regular niggles, so I'm not too worried about them. I just have to keep them under control and not let them get any worse.

I'll be going for a run this evening with Louise when I get home from work to bring the mileage up to where it should be.

Here's my morning run route
