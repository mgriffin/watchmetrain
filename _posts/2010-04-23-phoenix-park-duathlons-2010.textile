I decided this year to pre enter for the four duathlons in the phoenix park run by "Belpark":http://www.dublintri.com/duathlon.html 

They're taking place on 5th May, 2nd June, 7th July and 4th August. The first three are the same, a 2.7km run, 13km cycle and another 2.7km run. The last one has a different format. They're calling it a Formula 1, 2.7km run, 8.5km cycle, 2.7km run, 8.5km cycle and finally another 2.7km run. 

In previous years I would just turn up on the day and try and enter the race, but there was always a large queue and sometimes it was sold out. This way I am guaranteed a place and it will stop me from backing out at the last minute too.

There is a practice session on the course next Wednesday (28th April) as a warm up.
