  %h2 about me

  I'm a 35 year old guy living in Co. Kildare. I like to do lots of sports and outdoor activities. 
  I play gaelic football, canoe polo and have done a few triathlons.  I also like to run.

  I represented Ireland for a number of years in canoe polo and played in 3 European Championships 
  and 1 World Championship. I am also an international standard referee. I have completed 1 
  half-ironman and plan to do a full one at some stage in the near future.
