This is the raw source to my site at "http://watchmetrain.net":http://watchmetrain.net

I've taken a lot of inspiration from "Michael Montelone's site":http://michaelmonteleone.net/ with the code that he used to create his site. The Rakefile was originally lifted from him.

Feel free to browse around and see what I've done.

Don't take things from @_posts/@ or @images/@. Otherwise it's all fair game, but don't just do a complete site copy, please.
