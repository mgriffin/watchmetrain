h2. "http://watchmetrain.net":http://watchmetrain.net

A site to track my training over the long term so that I can get some stats.

Now running on "sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ with a few extra gems to make life easier.

  * redcloth - for textile conversion
  * rack-flash - to show messages when I'm logged in
  * xml-sitemap - to create a nice sitemap
  * chronic - easier date parsing
  * chronic_duration - nice time differences
  * chronic_distance - outputs the distances
