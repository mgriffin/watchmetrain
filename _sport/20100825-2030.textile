Run with Waggers from his house.
To the sluice, follow the path, cross the river and hard right onto the track. Follow this until you reach the patch again. Along the path and a sharp left up the hill. Follow to the car park and out to the main road. Left until the canal and along it until Leixlip. Left into the town and down Captain's hill. Stay left to go off the main road and right at the Fire Station. Up the hill and into the park again. Follow the path along and up the hill past the car park to the main road. Turn right and down past Laraghcon. Through Lucan and back to the house.

Comfortable pace, well able to talk the whole way through. Started off as it was getting dark and finished in the proper dark.
