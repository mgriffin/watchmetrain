First run with vibram fivefingers. Probably did too much on the road and not enough on the grass for the first run. 

They felt good on all terrains that I found, tarmac, concrete, gravel, grass, clay and deer poo. Very noticable that there is no heel on them even compared to the Nike Zooms I have been using recently.
