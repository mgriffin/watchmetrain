Run with Louise.
Started on the closed road, cross country to the Farmleigh junction, followed path to back of OSi. Cross country to the Furry Glen, along by the lake and onto the small road back to the main road. Cut into the forest and across the main road. Back to the closed road across the field. I did two laps, first was in 24 mins and second in 19. Easy pace all the way.
