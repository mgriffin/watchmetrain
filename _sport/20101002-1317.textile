Cycle to Kilcullen and back with Louise, Peter and Waggers
34km to Kilcullen in 1:40 with a prolonged stop for puncture repair to Louise's back wheel
Long leisurely food stop
Trip back through Kilcock and Maynooth to lengthen the journey in 1:55 including a shorter puncture stop

Fairly easy throughout, wet and windy weather. Headwind going to Kilcullen, mostly a tailwind on the way back
