h2. about me

I'm a 32 year old guy living in Co. Kildare. I like to do lots of sports and outdoor activities. I play gaelic football, canoe polo and have done a few triathlons.  I also like to run.

I represented Ireland for a number of years in canoe polo and played in 3 European Championships and 1 World Championship. I am also an international standard referee. I have completed 1 half-ironman and plan to do a full one at some stage in the near future.

h2. about this site

I wrote this site using "CakePHP":http://cakephp.org to track the mileage I do when training and commuting. I will be expanding it to track all the training I do, what equipment I use (and when to bin it) and anything else that I can think of tracking as time goes on.
