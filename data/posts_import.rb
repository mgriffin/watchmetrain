DB[:articles].insert(:title => "Dublin Marathon", :body => "I started it, I finished it, I just am nowhere to be seen in the results. Why, you might ask. And rightly so.  The reason is that I was running for someone else. Ronan decided ages ago that he wanted to run the marathon with some guys from work but between one thing and another he decided that he wouldn't be able to put in enough training to finish it.  I was going to do it anyway so instead of him being out of pocket, I said I'd take his place.  Not entirely right and honest, but nevertheless.

So, how did I do? Well, a four minute PB for a start. Which isn't to be sneezed at, especially when my longest run was 20km and there was only one of them. My other runs consisted of a few 10km and 12 km runs, but really only one a week. Some weeks I might have managed two. These also only started in the last four weeks.

My plans originally when I decided to do the race was to try and qualify for \"Boston\":http://www.bostonmarathon.org/ which would have meant getting in under three hours and ten minutes. As the day got closer, I started to think more about whether this was a realistic goal. Sure I can run a half in 1:29 but was that enough? It then dawned on me that I would be qualifying Ronan instead of me, so that plan sort of went out the window. I still wanted to get under 3:10 but not as much anymore.

I also dabbled with the thought of cycling in to the start from Celbridge (a nice 24km) and then running and cycling home again. This was with a view to Ironman distance training for next year. Instead I sourced a lift to and from the start and cycled in to collect my number in the RDS on the Sunday.

To the race itself. This was the 30th Dublin Marathon and as such there was a very big crowd. 12,000 or so, I believe. This was handled very well by the organisers and we were marshalled to the start and kept entertained by a DJ. The weather was also organised brilliantly. After a week of rain and wind, we had nothing but clear dry weather and the sun even graced us with its presence once or twice. 

Just as we were about to start I got nervous about the Polar footpod I was using and in the end turned it on and off about 4 times before the first mile was out. In the end, it gave up of its own accord and I only really have half a race recorded. The first 10km or was pretty uneventful. The usual side stepping and slow down/accelerate depending on the crowd surges. The Phoenix Park was nice to run through and we were provided with the entertainment of the St John's Ambulance getting their jeep stuck while trying to cross over a raised ditch. The sight of eight of them all trying to weigh down the front so that the wheels could get traction was a sight to behold.

Out of the park and into Chapelizod, across the Liffey and turn left towards Inchicore. At every SPAR shop we passed there was a samba band and cheering crowds. In fact for most of the route, there were at least some crowds. They were fantastic and surprisingly noisy. Next year I need to get a shirt with my name on it, because anyone that had one was being cheered on even more.

The half way point was reached in 1:36 which I was a little disappointed in, it was a tad slower than I wanted. But I was feeling good. I had taken on two gels at this stage, one at 6 miles and one at 12 or so. The distances were marked in a strangely Irish way. Mile markers for most of it, but then in the middle we got a 10km or other random km markers. 

There was a gel station at 15 miles and that was to be my next one. I grabbed two and a bottle of water to wash it down with. I only took one and kept the other until I would need it nearer the end. There was another gel station after the 18 mile marker (possibly 25km?). In between there were people out with jellies, bananas, water, sandwiches and I'm pretty sure there would have been tea if you'd asked.  

I felt pretty well throughout and didn't hit any substantial wall, at one stage I felt like I might like to walk but that was only my head asking me was I some sort of fool to think I could do this. I answered that I was, and my head gave up. It knew it wasn't going to win that argument. So on I plodded, sometimes it felt like I was almost floating, other times it took a bit more effort. I was almost looking forward to the hills and inclines as I managed to pass people out on them. 

Pretty much all the way from Foster's Avenue to Grand Canal Street I was alternately followed and following a girl in a yellow top, called Emer. All the crowd were giving her great encouragement and as long as I was near to her, I could soak some of it up. She seemed to be going pretty well, but with a mile left to go she dropped off my shoulder and I started to speed up a bit. There wasn't much left now. Just a little push and I'd be home. I lengthened out my stride, and then immediately remembered why I was keeping my cadence high with shorter steps. I was running much faster that way, so back to that style again. Turning on to Pearse Street, I realised that a mile was farther than a kilometre. Imagine, it took that long for it to sink in!

Then I was rounding on to Nassau Street, a quick look at my watch. 3:08. I could hardly make the length of Nassau Street in 2 minutes? Could I? I figured it was worth a shot but there was nothing else there. I had my pace and that was that. I passed the 26 mile marker and still had more to go. These were the hardest yards of the race. Pump the arms, move the legs, get closer and then there it was. I was over the finish line in 3:11:11 according to my watch.

Then the pain hit. Once you stop, your body realises what you have put it through for the last three hours and starts to complain. Hobble over to collect my medal and finishers t-shirt. Hobble through and collect the lovely SPAR lunchbox. Hobble around the corner and look happy as a picture is taken of you and your medal. Hobble to the end of the square to see where the physio massage is, great, it's at the end of the next side of the square. Hobble to collect your bag and then over to the massage tent. But no, it's not a massage tent, it's been transformed into a stretching tent. Apparantly a massage is _not_ the right thing to get straight away. So it's over to the kerb to put on the compression legs. Unfortunately as I am reaching down to undo my shoes, my hips start to cramp up.  Straighten out my leg and my calf begins to cramp. I got the legs on in the end and spend 5 minutes doing some stretches. Then it's off to walking again to get back and get a lift home.

I spent a few hours getting fed and watered with multiple cups of tea in Waggers' and Ronan's house before getting home here to write this up. It's now after 10pm and I'm finishing a celebratory beer before heading to bed. I think I've earned it!

A few months ago, Pauline mentioned an off road marathon in Wales and I entered before realising that she was going to do the half and not the full one. Greg and Waggers were then talked into doing the half as well.

h3. The Journey

We headed over on the Friday on the ferry from Rosslare and arrived in Gower before it got dark. We got to see some lovely countryside, hills and beaches that we would be running over. Then we went and bought food, cooked it up and went off to get registered. Registration was well organised and it only took us about 10 minutes before we were all done. Pauline arrived shortly after that and we all chatted before heading off to bed for an early night.

Next morning I was up and had breakfast before heading off for the briefing at 08:30. There they told us that they had to lengthen the course by about 2 miles. Wahoo, my first ultra!

h3. The Race

To the race. We started in the car park and raced off to the beach where we had been asked to pick up a piece of rubbish and put it in the bins at the end of the beach. One guy I saw ran most of the beach with a plastic bottle filled with water before realising and emptying it out. Then it was over the dunes and down into a caravan park for the first checkpoint. 24 mins for 2.8 miles.

Then we hit the hills, big climbs, fast downhills and lots of potholes filled with bog water. It was like being a kid again, jumping in puddles and dodging around some of them. The next checkpoint was at 11.4 miles and I got there in 1:41. I was still going well at this point.

More sand next before we headed onto a beach with a headwind. There were 5 of us together so a bike style paceline formed pretty quickly. After that nice section were lots of steps through a foresty bit that we were warned about earlier. It wasn't as slippy as it might have been, but there was no point in taking chances. 

Down more steps and onto a flattish cliff top run through fields. I had latched onto a guys shoulder and we were pushing each other on until he stepped aside and I was left on my own again. 

The next checkpoint was at the start of a beach which I had to run on my own this time. I was getting more mentally tired at this stage and the gel I had taken a few minutes before hadn't quite kicked in.

h3. A wall

The next bit is a bit of a haze, I ran past lots of sheep and walked a lot of uphills, even the slightest incline had me down to a walk. There were some off camber slopes and it was hard work trying to keep your footing.

The rain and wind also started around here so it was back on with the jacket and hat and head down to keep going.

Finally I got to the last checkpoint and they had jelly babies! It was the most welcome sight of the day so far. I was also joined by another guy and we decided between us that we had to finish the last 10km inside an hour. There was more walking of the uphills and laborious jogging on the flats and downs.

We got near to Worm's Head and I was back in a groove of just jogging on. I kept this up to the bottom of the last major climb and felt better for having pushed the pace a bit. 

The last climb was tough and slippy and when we got to the top, the other guy wanted to keep moving as he was getting cold. We passed out a few more people along the top of the ridge and eventually topped out on the final peak. From here it was all downhill to the finish.

The only problem with it was that it was downhill on ground akin to a ski slope. There was water running down and rocks sticking out. I lost my footing and landed on my back, bounced and was back up before I realised what had happened.

Over the line in 4:48 and 32nd place, the timing chip was taken and Greg arrived with a bacon buttie. Yum!

The rain was really pelting down by now and I got changed and went back to eat all the free Clif Bar samples.

Back to the house for food and then more food and some rugby on the telly. Feet up with some beers was the order of the night.

h3. Summary

Overall I was happy with the race, except for my nutrition. I only had one power bar and one gel in the entire race. For the Dublin marathon I had 5 gels. I definitely felt it late on in the race, I seem to be able to get along quite well to a point and then collapse. The trick for me is to start eating while I feel good and avoid that crash.

The race was well worth doing, the organisation was great and the course was beautiful. It also added quite a chunk to my December challenge.

By this evening I'll be over 170km for the month and going well. I find that my legs and feet are getting tighter and that is probably down to not stretching after I finish my runs.

We had some untypically cold weather over Christmas which didn't make it easy to get out and when I came over to Mayo, the only place to run was on the main N17 road which just wasn't safe. I decided then to skip the last 2 days of running and to do some swimming instead. I went over to the new pool in Claremorris and got a couple of swims in. It felt strange getting back into the pool and the first day wasn't that productive.

In the second session I noticed I had more of a feel for the water and I didn't get out of breath as easily. I was able to trot out 1km and then called it a day as the pool was closing. I suppose if I was to make a resolution at this time, it would have to be to get into the pool more often and consistently.

Into the park and back on to tarmac, cobbles and finally grass. The ground was very hard but it was definitely easier to run on the grass than anywhere else. A quick loop incorporating some deer poo and fallen sticks completed the terrain changes before heading back to work on the concrete and tarmac.

Off road running was easy, uphills and downhills were no problem. On road was a different matter. Uphills were fine but downhills and even flat sections needed a bit more thought. Because there is no cushioning at all, any heel striking to slow down is very noticible. This meant that I was trying to slow down on my toes which caused a little bit of chafing on the top of my foot.

My calves were tight anyway from running a couple of days ago but I still need to do a lot of stretching regardless of that. My legs will feel this tomorrow. ", :slug => "20100422-vibram-fivefingers", :published => true, :publish_date => "2010-04-22 12:00")

DB[:articles].insert(:title => "First Phoenix Park Duathlon", :body => "It's now two days later and the race results are out. I finished in 18th place in a time of 41 minutes and 30 seconds. I was reasonably pleased with that time but I know I can puch myself more and knock a bit off that.

The first run was about trying to keep enough in reserve so that I could push out on the second one. I did the lap in 9:13 which was decent. Nothing of note really happened. I just did my usual of picking a pair of heels and staying with them. When they got too close, I picked another pair and worked off them.

The cycle was a bit of a struggle to stay out of drafting zones. I was overtaken by some people that didn't seem too bothered about this and appeared to be working off each other. But that's for them to live with.

I could feel that I haven't been on my bike enough so far and wasn't able to push on the last straight as much as I wanted to. I also made a mistake of letting other people decide what I was going to do. I was coming to the end of the bike and had picked out where I was going to be taking my shoes off when I heard a rip of velcro from behind me. I paniced at this and thought I was doing something wrong so proceeded to take off my shoes. I then had at least 100m more than I wanted to push out of my shoes. I'll know for next time. I know best!

On the second run, I was ruffled after seeing 4 people come in together into transition. I was determined to pass them out but I didn't want to do it in the first 200m and risk blowing up. There was a guy behind me with the same idea and when he passed me out, I stayed on his shoulder for a while. I passed Louise about halfway around the lap and pressed on from there. I dropped the guy that had passed me and caught two more before the finish. I was also in a sprint finish but didn't have the legs to pull it out of the bag.

I now have a target for the next race and I think I know what I have to do to reach it. I will be pushing a bit more with some training and introducing some interval sessions which I haven't done properly since about this time last year.

DB[:articles].insert(:title => "M3 Cycle", :body => "I did the \"M3 Cycle\":http://www.m3cycle.ie/ on Sunday, a 100km cycle on the as yet unopened M3 motorway. It ended up being nearer to 108km and the motorway turned into dual carriageway for about 12km but at least there was no vehicular traffic. There was however a lot of bike traffic. 1400 people took part altogether over the three distances (100km, 54km and 14km).

The day started off early with registration in the Vortex nightclub. No I wasn't there from the night before! A leisurely coffee later and the group of us (Louise, Caoimhe, Aisling, Waggers and myself) headed off to park up on the motorway. We met Greg, Joe and Andy and put the bikes together, filled pockets with food and pumped up the tyres. 

The start was manic with everyone trying to find their space on the road and settle into a rhythm. Waggers and myself were working well together and passing groups at a rate of knots. We picked up a lot of stragglers and dropped some of them again. Eventually we caught up with Greg and his little band of merry cyclists. Greg wasn't too merry though. He was getting annoyed at the numpty cycling around him with people not doing their turn on the front and other annoying things. Personally, I was just glad to be out on the road and able to push as hard as I could for as long as possible.

I started flagging as we were a few km from the turn and took the ooportunity to down a gel and some water. This woke me up again and a banana at half way helped too. The last two km before the turn were a loooong drag up a hill. This split the group up a good bit. Coming back down it was nice though, even if I was frantically trying to peel the banana and not fall off.

I dropped Waggers shortly after this and thought I was on my own for a while until I heard the noise of a freewheel from behind me. I worked for about 10km but there was still no sign of anyone coming around to help me out. Finally they got the hint when I sat up and started to look around to see what was happening. Three ladies hanging on and none of them thought they were strong enough to work the front. It turned out that at least two of them were! 

We closed the gap up to Greg's group again and there was a nice chain gang working for a while. Every now and then someone would storm off the front, pedal maniacally for five minutes and then get caught and wheelsuck for the next twenty minutes.

After three hours and fifteen minutes, we passed the finish line, happy with what we had achieved and ready to eat any stray horses that were wandering around. Luckily there were bananas, biscuits, bars and sandwiches instead. Shortly after, Waggers arrived in and Joe wasn't too long behind him.

I went off to get changed and then back to the finish to wait for Louise. She came in after four hours and thirty minutes or so. She was very happy with it, if a bit tired! 

There was only one of the group still out there at this stage, we had missed Aisling, she was in a group with her cycling club. Andy was the sole remainder. Louise and myself decided to wait for him. And wait. And wait. And wait. He was the last person across the line! But he had finished it, and got the same cert that the rest of us did.

We dropped him back to his car at Sparky's and had some tea before going home and eating our weight in pasta bake.  A fantastic day, made better by the weather. It was dry all day long and only a little bit of wind which stayed as a tail wind most of the way home.

An average of 33km/h and 155bpm topped it all off, I wonder could I keep that up for another 80km?", :slug => "20100518-m3-cycle", :published => true, :publish_date => "2010-05-18 12:00")

This suited me alright as I had sprained my finger pretty badly the night before at training and I wasn't sure how it would hold up.

It was a typical local derby match with some aggro and mouthing but luckily it didn't boil over at any stage. We also had to deal with the new rules on handpassing (now a closed fist pass) and taking sideline kicks.

I registered and met up with Greg who was doing it as well. We wandered around and checked out the course a bit.

After getting changed and the race briefing it was off for a light jog to get the legs working again. Then on with the wetsuit and down to the shore to watch the \"short\" race. It turned out that the buoys were in the wrong place and the swim was quite long. It also seemed to be hard to see the buoys against the sun as most people took the wrong line back in and aimed for buoy four instead of three.

After some comical shouts of \"It's behind you\" from the watching public, the first swimmers came out and headed off for their run. This meant it was time to go and check out the water. 

While we were warming up (or cooling down or whatever you do in the sea) two of the buoys were moved to shorten our swim lap. Back to the beach then for the run in start.

The hooter went and we waded back out until it got deep enough to swim. I was in the middle of the pack which was a new experience for me. Past the first buoy and on to the second, I was warming up nicely. Around the second buoy, sight the third and off we go, straight into a shoal of jellyfish. Luckily they weren't stingers but it threw me a little. We were in the cold channel here and it was starting to affect my hands, but when we turned the third buoy, the water warmed up again. 

Trying not to get caught in the rope of the last buoy was the problem. It was a bit long and drifting in the direction we were swimming. One more lap to go. Back around by the jellyfish, I hit one with my nose this time. And then it was the last long dolphin, swim, walk to the finish.

Out of the water and down came the wetsuit. The run wasn't too bad to transition and the matting helped. I took off the wetsuit but putting on my shoes took a few seconds longer than expected and there was a woozy second as I stood up again. But I was away on the run.

It was a lovely flat run, out along the pier, turn at the lighthouse and back again. Then around the finish chute and back out again for another lap. I felt really good during the run and even managed to push it out for the last 800m or so.

I finished in 44:27 which I was happy with. The swim took me about 21 minutes and with a long transition, I reckon the run was about 20-21 minutes.

After the great prize giving, we headed to Beshoffs for many family meal deals. Cod and chips, a perfect post race recovery meal!

The swim start had to be moved 5km down the road due to rocks and debris in the original swim spot, so that meant a split transition. I dropped my bike down and set it all up. Well most of it. I couldn't find my pump or repair kit and thought I had left them at home. I had resigned myself to getting a flat and DNFing until I was getting changed and found them both, along with my HRM strap, in my bag rather than the box with the rest of my gear.

The swim was a two lap affair and we were supposed to get out of the water and run around a traffic cone. The area was too rocky so they moved the cone into the water instead. I did a reasonable 15 minute swim even though I felt like I was struggling the whole time.

!/images/loughallen/IMG_0028.JPG!

The bike leg started with me being passed by two guys that appeared to be working hard together for as long as I could see them. I got into my rhythm and started passing people out. Going through Dowra I was cheered on by a guy I had played a match with the night before. 

From there it was a tough rolling road on to Drumkeerin where we were greeted with a wide, well surfaced, long downhill. Into top gear and keep pedalling! I was passed out by a couple of guys here but kept them in view until the transition.

!/images/loughallen/IMG_0045.JPG!

On the run I was feeling very weary. I had a sore leg that didn't like downhills and tired legs that didn't like uphills. I still managed to pass out some people on the way out and kept myself occupied with counting how many were in front of me. I managed to get through the run despite my head telling me to stop on a number of occasions and finished in 11th place overall.

It was a tough day out there. I need to swim more often. The cycle was into a headwind for the first half and even the downhills felt hard, but the second half made up for it.

The junction with the road that goes through Chapelizod road and up Knockmaroon hill is always busy and every time I have cycled through it I have seen not one but at least two cars (and sometimes three) push through when the light is red. They are always coming from the town side.

This morning was a little different. I was stopped at the lights, clipped out and saw the light go orange for the other cars. This means that we are going to get the green light next so I clipped in and got ready to go. The light went green and I started off. Then from my left a car decides that it still has time to go through the junction. Luckily they stopped when they saw me and waved apologetically. 

I got past the junction and looked back to see the car continuing on through the junction, forcing the other cars to yield for her. I couldn't believe it! Not only had she tried to jump the light and stopped to let someone go, she then carried on through with what she wanted. She wasn't blocking the junction in any way when she let me by so why did she think she had the right of way?

I read the letter pages in newpapers when I can because sometimes there are some good letters but mostly for a laugh at the opinionated writers. There are usually a few giving out about cyclists going through red lights and not paying attention to the rules of the road. This is then used as reasoning why cyclists should not be allowed to use the road. In this instance, I find it hard to not think the same about drivers.

This is not the only junction in Dublin that this happens at, but thankfully it's the only one that I have to go through on a regular basis.

I had left my shoes on the bike after the first bike leg and thought that I would be okay putting them on while on the bike.

Quite a rush to be flying past people on the rougher area of the path, all the while trying to catch that pesky group ahead of me.

There was some back and forth between myself and another guy on the bike and we both got into transition around the same time. Onto the run and I had some targets in my sights. Before the half way point, I heard heavy breathing and footsteps behind me and was passed out. I tried to hang on to him, but no luck, he was flying!

!/images/formula-1/IMG_6591.JPG!

Into the last straight and out of the wind, I tried to push on again but the spag bol I had eaten earlier was trying it's best to say hello again. I had to ease off and this let the guy I had passed earlier to fly past me in the last 100m. I couldn't respond and he finished 2 seconds ahead of me.

I finished in 1:01:22 in 19th place and 5:57 behind the winner. I'm happy with that time, maybe I could have beaten the hour if I had trained for it but with the work I have (haven't) done, it's a good result.

The wind was very strong on the run. The second part of the lap was right into a headwind and I think most people struggled. On the bike it felt at times I was wrestling a walrus! I need to get some more time on the tri bike and get used to those race wheels in the breeze.

I came straight from Celbridge with Louise and was there in plenty of time. When the team was read out I was quite disappointed not to be starting. It's been a long time since that happened! 

There was a strong wind blowing right down the pitch and we opted to play against it in the first half. Templeport got into their stride quicker and seemed to be sharper to the ball, but then Neven scored a mis hit goal to put us in front. We were still in front at half time but Templeport were looking dangerous with high balls and from frees.

I went out for the half time entertainment and even against the wind was kicking over a few points which gave me more confidence. 

Templeport came all out in the second half and we were finding it hard to get any rhythm going. About half way through I was called to warm up, I was going in. In I went to corner back and immediately the jostling and the digs started. I was knocked over and the unpire told both of us to cool it. Crazy seeing as I was the one getting hit. Anyway, first ball comes in and the corner forward goes down like a ton of bricks, free to Templeport. I decided the best way to play him from then on was to read the game better and get to the ball on my own. This worked better and I managed to clear a few dangerous balls out of defence.

He really wanted to get the ball and started wandering out past half way. I was happy to let him go and pick him up again as he came back. But then he changed his ideas and started to stay on the edge of the square looking for the high ball in. They were getting desperate. Shane cleared a few from the small square and it seemed like the danger was over, but then from nothing, they got a goal. This put three between us again and they piled forward to try and get another goal. I never felt like they would and in the end they ran out of time without any more chances.

In the first half, we played with the wind and managed to go in up by two points. It maybe should have been more as we spurned a couple of goal chances and had a few bad wides. But we were happy enough and confident we could keep going in the right direction.

Unfortunately the second half started and we were all at sea. We lost midfield entirely and were unable to get out of our own half. We conceded a few points and they hit the crossbar before getting the goal that had been coming for a while. We had to make some changes around the middle and centre back and this changed how we were playing too. 

In the end we lost by 6 points, but we were well beaten before the final whistle. Even when we got a few points back we were still fighting amongst ourselves and there was no one able to stand up and lead us through the hard patches. 

I was really disappointed as I felt I had been bypassed in the match again, not the first time that has happened this year. I wasn't able to get into the game at all even though I was really up for it beforehand. I don't know whether I lwt myself drift out of games or if there is a way to force my way back in.
