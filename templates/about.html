  <h2>about me</h2>
  I'm a 35 year old guy living in Co. Kildare. I like to do lots of sports and
  outdoor activities.  I play gaelic football, canoe polo and have done a few
  triathlons.  I also like to run.  I represented Ireland for a number of years
  in canoe polo and played in 3 European Championships and 1 World
  Championship. I am also an international standard referee. I have raced in
  the Swiss 70.3 and the Lanzarote Ironman.
